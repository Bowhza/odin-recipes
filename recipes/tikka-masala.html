        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine garlic, ginger, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, and cumin in a small bowl.
                <br> Whisk yogurt, salt, and half of spice mixture in a medium bowl;
                <br> add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and chill 4-6 hours. Cover and chill remaining spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. 
                <br>Add onion, tomato paste, cardamom, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft, about 5 minutes.
                <br>Add remaining half of spice mixture and cook, stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them. 
                <br>Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside sheet.
                <br>Arrange chicken on rack in a single layer. Broil until chicken starts to blacken in spots (it will not be cooked through), about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, add to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, 
                <br>until chicken is cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Serve with rice and cilantro sprigs.</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
